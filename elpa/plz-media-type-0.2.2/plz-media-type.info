plz-media-type
**************

‘plz-media-type’ is an Emacs Lisp library that enhances MIME type
handling for HTTP requests within Emacs.  It leverages the plz.el
(https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el) HTTP library for networking calls
and introduces a mechanism to process responses based on the content
type header.  This library defines various classes and methods for
parsing and processing standard MIME types, including JSON, XML, HTML,
and binary data.  It is used in the LLM (https://github.com/ahyatt/llm)
library to handle decoding of various streaming and non-streaming media
type formats.

1.1 GNU ELPA
============

‘plz-media-type’ is available in GNU ELPA
(http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/plz-media-type.html).  It may be installed
in Emacs using the ‘package-install’ command.

2 Usage
*******

The main function, ‘plz-media-type-request’, works similarly to the plz
(https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el?tab=readme-ov-file#functions)
function but with an additional feature.  When the ‘:as’ option is set
to ‘(media-types MEDIA-TYPES)’, the HTTP response is decoded based on
the content type header.  The ‘MEDIA-TYPES’ association list defines a
mapping from content type symbols to instances of media type classes.
These classes determine how the response is processed.

   When using the media type option:

   • Synchronous requests return a ‘plz-response’ structure or signal an
     error.

   • Asynchronous requests return a process object and pass a
     ‘plz-response’ structure to the ‘THEN’ callback and a ‘plz-error’
     structure to the ‘ELSE’ callback.

2.1 Quick Start
===============

The ‘plz-media-types’ variable contains a list of pre-configured media
type mappings.  The following code makes a synchronous ‘GET’ request to
a URL and returns a ‘plz-response’ structure.  Since the response is
returned with the content type header set to ‘application/json’, the
‘plz-media-type:application/json’ class will be used to decode the HTTP
body.

     (plz-media-type-request
       'get "https://httpbin.org/json"
       :as `(media-types ,plz-media-types))

===============

The following table shows the media type classes provided by the
‘plz-media-type’ library.  The ‘Content Type’ and ‘Default’ columns
indicate which media type is part of the default ‘plz-media-types’ and
which content type header values trigger their use.  The ‘Stream’ column
specifies whether the class consumes data in a streaming or
non-streaming way.

2.2.1 JSON
----------

The ‘plz-media-type:application/json’ media type class handles JSON
responses.  It parses the response body using ‘json-parse-buffer’ after
receiving the entire response.

   *Customization:*

   Instances of this class can be customized by setting the following
slots:

   • ‘:array-type’: Lisp type used for arrays (‘array’ or ‘list’,
     default ‘array’)
   • ‘:false-object’: Object representing JSON ‘false’ (default
     ‘:json-false’)
   • ‘:null-object’: Object representing JSON ‘null’ (default ‘nil’)
   • ‘:object-type’: Lisp type used for objects (‘hash-table’, ‘alist’,
     or ‘plist’, default ‘alist’)

   *Example:*

     (plz-media-type-request
       'get "https://httpbin.org/json"
       :as `(media-types
             ((application/json
               . ,(plz-media-type:application/json :array-type 'list)))))

     #s(plz-response 2 200
                     ((date . "Sun, 24 Mar 2024 10:05:19 GMT")
                      (content-type . "application/json")
                      (content-length . "429")
                      (server . "gunicorn/19.9.0")
                      (access-control-allow-origin . "*")
                      (access-control-allow-credentials . "true"))

2.2.2 Newline Delimited JSON Stream
-----------------------------------

The ‘plz-media-type:application/x-ndjson’ media type class handles
newline-delimited JSON responses in a streaming fashion.  It parses each
line using ‘json-parse-buffer’ and calls the ‘:handler’ function for
each decoded object.  The body slot of the ‘plz-response’ structure will
always be ‘nil’.

   *Customization:*

   • ‘:handler’: Function called for each JSON object.

   *Example:*

     (plz-media-type-request
       'get "https://httpbin.org/stream/5"
       :as `(media-types
             ((application/json
               . ,(plz-media-type:application/x-ndjson
                   :handler (lambda (object)
                              (message "%s" object)))))))

     #s(plz-response 2 200
                     ((date . "Sun, 24 Mar 2024 10:06:51 GMT")
                      (content-type . "application/json")
                      (server . "gunicorn/19.9.0")
                      (access-control-allow-origin . "*")
                      (access-control-allow-credentials . "true"))
                     nil)

2.2.3 JSON Array Stream
-----------------------

The ‘plz-media-type:application/json-array’ media type class handles
JSON responses where the top-level object is an array.  It parses each
object in the array using ‘json-parse-buffer’ and calls the ‘:handler’
function for each decoded object.

   *Customization:*

   • ‘:handler’: Function called for each JSON object.

   *Example:*

     (plz-media-type-request
       'get "https://localhost/json-array"
       :as `(media-types
             ((application/json
               . ,(plz-media-type:application/json-array
                   :handler (lambda (object)
                              (message "%s" object)))))))

2.2.4 XML
---------

The ‘plz-media-type:application/xml’ media type class handles XML
responses.  It parses the response body using ‘libxml-parse-html-region’
after receiving the entire response.

   *Customization:* None

   *Example:*

     (plz-media-type-request
       'get "https://httpbin.org/xml"
       :as `(media-types ((application/xml . ,(plz-media-type:application/xml)))))

Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.—Most miserable! A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate. Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight, on the road running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's drama. He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family's heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber. Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing competency.\n        ")

3.1 Debugging HTTP responses
============================

It might be useful to see the full HTTP response while developing a new
media type format or ‘plz-media-type’ is failing to parse a response of
an HTTP request.  When the ‘plz-media-type-debug-p’ custom variable is
set to a non-nil value, each chunk of the HTTP response is written to
the buffer configured by the ‘plz-media-type-debug-response-buffer’
custom variable as it arrives.  The buffer is cleared on each new
request, unless ‘plz-media-type-debug-erase-buffer-p’ is set to a
non-nil value.
